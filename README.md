# Katok UI

> **KakaoTalk (카카오톡) UI components for React** — an unofficial shadcn/ui registry of Kakao / KakaoTalk mobile (iOS) chat UI, plus the first open-source **Kakao AlimTalk (카카오 알림톡) and Brand Message (브랜드메시지) preview** components.

If you send Kakao Biz Messages — from a SaaS dashboard, a CRM, or an internal admin — you need a preview that looks like what customers actually see in KakaoTalk. Teams keep rebuilding `AlimtalkPreview` from scratch. This registry gives you that, plus the core chat UI, ready to drop into a React app.

> "Katok" (카톡) is the everyday nickname for KakaoTalk. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Kakao Corp. No Kakao logos, characters, or font files are included.

## Install

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://katok-ui.jeongmin.dev/r/alimtalk-bubble.json
```

Each component is independent — it brings the files it needs (tokens, icons, shared bubble layout).

## What's included

| Component | |
|---|---|
| `chat-bubble` | Yellow outgoing / white incoming, first-bubble tail, unread count "1", time, "수정됨" |
| `message-group` | Consecutive messages: squircle avatar + name on the first, tail on the first, time on the last |
| `profile-avatar` | Squircle, default silhouette, 2–4 member group-chat composites |
| `chat-header` | iOS 26 floating glass pills: back + unread total, centered title + member count, search + menu; large-title tab header |
| `message-input` | Floating pill: round `+`, auto-grow, emoji, `#` that turns into the yellow send button; IME-safe Enter |
| `date-separator` | Date pill + `formatKakaoDate()` |
| `system-message` | Join / leave / invite / deleted notices |
| `chat-list-item` | Chats tab row: unread badge, mute, pin, member count, `render` polymorphism |
| `chat-room` | Layout shell: header, message log, input, custom theme background |
| `alimtalk-bubble` | `messageType` BA/EX/AD/MI × `emphasizeType` NONE/TEXT/IMAGE/ITEM_LIST, buttons, quick replies — matched against the Kakao Business guide |
| `brand-message-bubble` | `chatBubbleType` TEXT/IMAGE/WIDE/CAROUSEL_FEED, ticket coupons, opt-out line; `adSenderName()` for the "(광고)" sender label |
| `biz-button` | Biz Message buttons using API codes (WL, AL, DS, BK, MD, BC, BT, AC, BF, TN, P1–P3) |

### Biz Message props mirror the API

```tsx
<MessageGroup sender={{ name: "미리마켓", avatar: "/shop.png" }}>
  <AlimtalkBubble
    messageType="BA"
    emphasizeType="TEXT"
    subtitle="배송 출발 안내"
    title="오늘 도착 예정"
    content={template.content}
    buttons={[{ type: "DS", name: "배송 조회" }]}
  />
</MessageGroup>
```

Length limits follow the Kakao Business content guide (body 1,300, or 1,000 with an item list; title 50; item list header 16; buttons ≤ 5 …). Over-limit text is cut with an ellipsis and warned in development, and every bubble takes a `limits` override.

## Design tokens

No official KakaoTalk design system is public. Tokens are reconstructed and **every value carries an evidence grade**: official (developers.kakao.com), official theme-creation spec, measured from Kakao's own App Store screenshots and Business guides, measured on device, or clone approximation. Token names follow KakaoTalk's theme slots, so a custom theme is a handful of CSS variables.

Storybook's **Kakao/Reference** pages put each screen next to Kakao's imagery. Those images aren't redistributed: `pnpm refs:fetch` downloads them locally.

See [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm storybook      # http://localhost:6006
pnpm dev            # landing + registry routes
pnpm test           # unit tests (limits, coupon formats)
